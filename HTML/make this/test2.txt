Homework Assignment #1: Lists


Part 1: Write the HTML
 
What's your favorite food? Do you know how to make it yourself? If not, look up the recipe online. Next, create an HTML document, and within the body of the page, create two lists:

1. The first list should be an unordered list of all the ingredients needed to make the dish.

2. The second list should be an ordered list, detailing the steps you need to take to prepare that dish.

Then, add comments to your HTML, to explain the purpose of each section of code that you create.


Part 2: Save the HTML

Once you have created your document, save the file as a ".html" file. For example, the name of the file could be "recipe.html" or "homework1.html" etc.



Homework Assignment #2: Images


Part 1: Write the HTML
 
It's time to make your recipe (from homework #1) a little more exciting.

1. Add a title to your page (within the <head>) and an actual <h1> title on the page.
2. Below the h1, add a paragraph that explains what the food is, and why you like it so much.
3. Somewhere on the page, add a few images of finished versions of your dish so that the reader can see what the final product should look like.
4. Add emojis to your second list (the ordered list), so that at least 5 of the lines end with an emoji character. You can find emojis online pretty easily. If you don't how to use emojis in HTML, read this article. Then use this reference.https://www.kirupa.com/html5/emoji.htm
